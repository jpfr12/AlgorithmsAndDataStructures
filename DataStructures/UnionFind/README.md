 # What is *Union Find*? (source: Book "Competitive Programming 3")  

 * The Union-Find Disjoint Set (UFDS) is a data structure to model a collection of disjoint sets with the ability to efficiently24—in ≈ O(1)—determine which set an item belongs to (or to test whether two items belong to the same set) and to unite two disjoint sets into one larger set. Such data structure can be used to solve the problem of finding connected components in an undirected graph. Initialize each vertex to a separate disjoint set, then enumerate the graph’s edges and join every two vertices/disjoint sets connected by an edge. We can then test if two vertices belong to the same component/set easily.
