    1. Problem name: "Living with Courage"  

        - webside: https://www.spoj.com/problems/COURAGE/  

        - Straight-foward Segment Tree  

        - We can use only one Segment Tree that does both minimum range and sum range queries  

        - My solution for this problem can be found in "LivingwithCourage.cpp"  

    2. Problem name: "payraise"  

        - website: https://codebreaker.xyz/problem/payraise  

        - This problem requires to implement the euler tour on the given tree, memorizing the left and right limit for each worker. Then create a Segment Tree on top of the euler tour in order to do the given queries.  

        - this problem requires the "Lazy Segment Tree" in order to give fast answers.  

        - My solution to this problem can be found in the "payraise.cpp"
