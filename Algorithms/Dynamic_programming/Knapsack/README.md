## Knapsack (source wikipedia)

- The knapsack problem is the following problem in combinatorial optimization:  

    - *Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.*  

- It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision-makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.  

- The knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with early works dating as far back as 1897.
