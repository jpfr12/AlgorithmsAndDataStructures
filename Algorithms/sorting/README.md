#Sorting Algorithms
---
1. Comparison Algorithms:
  1.1. Insertion Sort
  - Time complexity: O(n^2) (Worst case) or O(n) (if the array is already sorted)
  - Space complexity: O(1)
  1.2. Quick Sort
  - Time complexity: O(n^2) (if we choose a bad pivot) or O(nlogn)
  - Space complexity: O(1)
  1.3. Merge Sort
  - Time complexity: O(nlogn)
  - Space complexity: O(n)

2. Non-comparison Algorithms:
  1.1. Counting Sort
  - Time complexity: O(n+k)
  - Space complexity: O(n+k)
  1.2. Radix Sort (TODO)
